# summer-sessions-2019

## Note: Announcements will be made through the repo's issues page, so please subscribe to the repo (by clicking the 'watch' button) to receive notifications.

A series of lectures and hands-on tutorials organized between the 6th of May 2019 and 20th of June 2019 to familiarize new lab entrants with the fundaments of different areas of robotics research that the lab conducts.

An Important aspect of this session will be getting familiar with various robots and sensors present in the lab. This knowledge/skill will be critical as some of the assignments will involve using these systems to collect data and/or execute the algorithms.

## Venue and Timings:
* Venue : Nilgiri 119(Saranga Hall)
* Timings : 1500 Hrs to 1700 Hrs 


## Tentative topics:

**Lab Robots & other Hardwares:** ROS (Robot Operating System), Cameras(Monocular, Stereo, RGBD), Lidars, IMUs, Flight controllers, Husky Robot, P3DX Robot, Bebeop Drone, GPS, etc.

**Fundamentals of Linear Algebra, Calculus and Optimization:** Vectors, Matrices, Vector and Matrix operations, Important matrices, Matrix decompositions, Gradient, Hessian, Linear and non-linear least squares, Unconstrained optimization methods, Lagrange multipliers.

**Rigid Body Transformations:**Rotation matrices, Homogeneous Transformation matrices, Rigid Body transformation, Composition of transformation by current-axis and fixed-axis conventions.

**Geometric methods in Computer Vision:** Projective geometry, Camera modelling, Homographies, Two-view geometry, Triangulation, SfM, Visual odometry.


**Deep learning for Computer Vision & Tensor Flow:**

**Motion Planning:** Robot modelling, Motion Planning overview, Sampling based planning, Variational methods for planning.

**Reinforcement Learning:** Markov Processes, Planning using Dynamic Programming, Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, Model Free RL(TD learning, SARSA, Importance Sampling), table Q-learning,  Value Function Approximation(Incremental and Batch), Deep Q Networks(DQN), Policy Gradients(REINFORCE, Actor-Critic Methods). (Additionally we can also cover Deep RL(DQN, Double DQN, Asynchronous DQN, Bayesian RL, TRPO, PPO, Inverse RL etc.)  if we have time).
